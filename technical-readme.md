**PortableID Technical Overview**

PortableID is a decentralized identity system built on Polkadot where users own and control their digital identity through a mobile wallet. Users generate their own Decentralized Identifier (DID) locally on their device and store it encrypted using platform keystores (Secure Enclave on iOS, Android Keystore on Android). When an NGO, clinic, or school needs to issue a credential (e.g., vaccination record, education certificate), they do so through the issuer web portal or API, signing it with their private key. The credential is cryptographically signed using BBS+ signatures, which enables selective disclosure—users can prove facts (like "I'm vaccinated") without revealing unnecessary details like specific dates or medical history.

The identity parachain anchors the trust layer by maintaining three critical on-chain components: an issuer registry (who is authorized to issue credentials), a revocation commitment list (which credentials have been revoked), and public DID directories (so anyone can discover how to contact a user's identity). Crucially, no personal data is stored on-chain—only cryptographic hashes and issuer metadata. This minimizes privacy exposure while maintaining immutability. When an issuer revokes a credential, they submit a batched Merkle root to the parachain instead of individual revocations, reducing transaction costs. Off-chain workers periodically publish these batches, ensuring revocation information is always available and auditable.

When a user needs to prove their identity or credentials, they use the mobile wallet to generate a presentation—a cryptographic proof of specific attributes without revealing everything. For offline scenarios (common in refugee camps or areas with poor connectivity), users generate QR codes containing their presentation. A verifier (clinic, bank, employer) scans the QR code offline, validates the cryptographic signatures locally, and checks the revocation status when they next go online. For online scenarios, the verifier app contacts the parachain in real-time to confirm the credential hasn't been revoked, providing instant verification.

The backend APIs (Node.js) handle all issuer and verifier operations, connecting to PostgreSQL for metadata storage and Redis for caching. The issuer portal lets organizations register, create credential schemas, issue credentials in bulk, and manage revocations. The verifier service exposes endpoints to validate presentations and check credential status. All communication is authenticated via JWT tokens, with rate limiting and anomaly detection to prevent abuse. The audit-logs service aggregates all events (issuance, verification, revocation) into Elasticsearch for compliance, allowing complete audit trails for regulatory requirements like GDPR.

Recovery and key management use threshold social recovery—users designate 3-5 guardians (trusted contacts) who hold shares of a recovery key. If a user loses their phone, they contact their guardians, and any 2-3 of them can help restore access without compromising security. For enterprises, hardware key support (HSM) is available. The entire system is designed with privacy-first principles: pairwise DIDs prevent cross-service tracking, selective disclosure limits data exposure, and the parachain stores only what's necessary. Everything is standards-based (W3C Verifiable Credentials, Decentralized Identifiers) ensuring interoperability beyond PortableID.
